\title{Optimize ensemble weights via quadratic programming}
\usage{
.optimize_weights(
  cv_predictions,
  y,
  family = "gaussian",
  weights = NULL,
  lower_bound = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cv_predictions}{Matrix of CV predictions (n x K)}

\item{y}{True outcomes}

\item{family}{"binomial" or "gaussian"}

\item{weights}{Observation weights}

\item{lower_bound}{Lower bound for weights (default 0)}
}
\value{
Named vector of optimal weights
}
\description{
Finds optimal convex combination weights that minimize CV loss.
Weights are constrained to be non-negative and sum to 1.
}
\details{
Solves the quadratic program:
\deqn{\min_\alpha \frac{1}{2} \alpha' D \alpha - d' \alpha}
subject to:
\deqn{\sum_k \alpha_k = 1}
\deqn{\alpha_k \geq 0}

Uses the \code{quadprog} package for the optimization.
