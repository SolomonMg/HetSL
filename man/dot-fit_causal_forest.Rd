\title{Fit Causal Forest model}
\usage{
.fit_causal_forest(X, y, treatment, family = "gaussian", weights = NULL, ...)
}
\description{
Uses the grf package to fit a causal forest.
Note: Causal forest directly estimates treatment effects, so we need to
convert this to outcome predictions for the ensemble framework.
